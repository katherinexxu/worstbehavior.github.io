<p> Before I held you, I didn’t know<br>
That the world I was in<br>
Was this <a href="9.18.html">bright</a><br>
I reached you with a small breath of life<br>
It’s a love that called out to me fearlessly<br>

I liked it so much<br>
Watching over you, my heart fluttering<br>
Even when I was ridiculously jealous<br>
All of those ordinary moments<br>
In the dark eternity<br>
In that long wait<br>
Like sunshine, you fell down to me<br>


Before I let go of you, I didn’t know<br>
That the world I am in<br>
Was this lonely<br>
Pretty flowers bloomed and withered here<br>
The season of you will never come again<br>

I started to become greedy<br>
I wanted to live with you, grow old with you<br>
Hold your wrinkled hands<br>
And say how warm my life was<br>

It was just one blessing<br>
After that short encounter<br>
You cried like the rain<br>
I wanted to be happy for once<br>
But that made you cry<br>
Forget everything and move on<br>
Because I will go to you<br>
When your breath calls out to me again<br>

I won’t ever forget<br>
Watching over you, my heart fluttering<br>
Even when I was ridiculously jealous<br>
All of those moments that you gave to me<br>
Some day, we’ll meet again<br>
It’ll be the happiest day<br>
I will go to you like the first snow<br>
I will go to you.<br>

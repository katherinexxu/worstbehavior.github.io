<h1>Christmas Eve</h1>

<p>
<img src="quote2.jpeg" style="float:right;width:700px;height:600spx; position: relative;">
<p>I wished for a snowy night on your birthday.</p>
<p>December night fall upon us fast, but you held my hand</p>
<p>and said, "let's go."</p>
<p>The way you smiled after picking me up.<br>
The way you held my hand to warm it up even though yours was colder.<br>
The way your eyes carried so much light and warm.<br>
Step by step,<br>
we walked to the LIRR Station. Interslocking our hands so tight.</p>
<p>Step by step,<br>
we walked on clouds. Thinking we reached <a href="eternal.html">heaven</a>
<p>Step by step,<br>
we walked towards your home. My safe haven. </p>
<p>Step by step...step by step...step by step...I looked at you and said<br>
“I love you.”</p>
